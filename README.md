# SmartBp Blood Pressure

Overview
The SmartBP Blood Pressure State Checker is a small web application designed to help users monitor their blood pressure readings using diastolic (dia) and systolic (sys) values. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for tracking and interpreting blood pressure measurements.
